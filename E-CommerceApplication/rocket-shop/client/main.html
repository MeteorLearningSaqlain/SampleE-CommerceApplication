<!-- Any <head> tag that is in a html file and not inside the <template> tag is
     appended to the head of the page automatically by meteor. You may choose to have
     numerous files with <head>. They are all combined into a single <head> and appended
     at the end the <head> tag of your app. Do a 'view page source' and look at the last
     lines of the head. You will find the head content of all your files separated by an
     empty line.
